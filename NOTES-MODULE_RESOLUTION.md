# Webpack Module Resolution

### Main Concept

A resolver is a library that helps locate a module by it's absolute path.

##### 1. Resolving rules in webpack -

Using `enhanced-resolve` we can resolve three kinds of paths -
1. Absolute paths
2. Relative paths
3. Module paths

##### 2. Resolved Loaders -

You can use the `resolveLoader` just like file resolution.
